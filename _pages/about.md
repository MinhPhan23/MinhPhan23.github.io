## Projects

[**Eck**](https://github.com/MinhPhan23/Eck)  
*October 2023*  
*Multi-threaded API web server, distributed database*  
- Created a multi-threaded API web server that served dynamic content using JavaScript where users could post and update their thoughts, requests were done using JavaScript’s XMLHttpRequest tool.
- Developed a 2 Phase Commit database using Python with the tiered model to store all posts and communicate with the web server using HTTP, making the database distributed, consistent and able to handle large volumes of concurrent requests.
